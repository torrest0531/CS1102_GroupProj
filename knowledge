    <h1> What is the differnces of HTTP and HTTPS?
        <p>  
            The major difference between HTTP and HTTPS is how they handle the data sent out when HTTPS will perform encryption, but HTTP won't.

    <h2>What do HTTP look like?
        <p>
            When performing various internet actions and events, data communication occurs, and the process can be monitored or reviewed by using the network analyser tool named a packet analyser, 
            also known by several names, such as packet sniffer, protocol analyser, or network analyser.<br> 
            Wireshark is one of the popular packet analysers in ethical hacking and illegal attacks; 
            in the following part, we will use Wireshark to review the packet while browsing the <a href="http://web.simmons.edu/~grovesd/comm244/notes/week2/links"> Reference HTTP Website</a> 
            and see what HTTP look like.
        </p>
        <p>
            An HTTP packet is usually divided into two parts: HTTP request and HTTP response. HTTP is performed under the distributed application structure called the clientâ€“server model. 
            It is a model of two attributes of client and server: the client ( a machine like a smartphone or laptop) will send a request through the internet, and the server will respond with the requested information back to the client.<br>

            In this part, it will use a LAB under a virtual server to perform an ARP Spoofing Attack on the victim's computer and 
            Showcase what will happen if your machine gets attacked and the consequences of using HTTP when browsing.

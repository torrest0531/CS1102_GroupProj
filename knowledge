            When performing various internet actions and events, data communication occurs, and the process can be monitored or reviewed by using the network analyser tool named a packet analyser, 
            also known by several names, such as packet sniffer, protocol analyser, or network analyser.<br> 
            Wireshark is one of the popular packet analysers in ethical hacking and illegal attacks; 
            in the following part will use Wireshark to review the packet while browsing the <a href="http://web.simmons.edu/~grovesd/comm244/notes/week2/links"> Reference HTTP Website</a> 
            and see how HTTP look like.

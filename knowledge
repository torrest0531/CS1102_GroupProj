    <h1> Why HTTPS is better than HTTP?
        <p>  
            The major difference between HTTP and HTTPS is how they handle the data sent out when HTTPS will perform encryption, but HTTP won't.

    <h2> What does an HTTP packet look like?
        <p>
            When performing various internet actions and events, data communication occurs, and the process can be monitored or reviewed by using the network analyser tool named a packet analyser, 
            also known by several names, such as packet sniffer, protocol analyser, or network analyser.<br> 
            Wireshark is one of the popular packet analysers in ethical hacking and illegal attacks; 
            in the following part, there will use Wireshark to review the packet while browsing the <a href="http://web.simmons.edu/~grovesd/comm244/notes/week2/links"> Reference HTTP Website</a> 
            and see what HTTP look like.
        </p>
        <p>
            An HTTP packet is usually divided into two parts: HTTP request and HTTP response. HTTP is performed under the distributed application structure called the clientâ€“server model. 
            It is a model of two attributes of client and server: the client ( a machine like a smartphone or laptop) will send a request through the internet, and the server will respond with the requested information back to the client.<br>

        </p> 
        <p>
            The HTTP request is always located at the beginning of a data packet containing communication information between the client and server. <br>
            <br>
            <br> GET /~grovesd/comm244/notes/week2/links HTTP/1.1<br>

            The HTTP response is the process server sending back the requested informatin to client and this is how a HTTP response in real life.

                As you can see, after sending a request to browse an HTTP website, the server will send back the HTTP response with website HTML, 
                and the information is fully disclosed without any encryption.

    <h3>  What does an HTTPS packet look like?   
        <p>
            As mentioned in the previous part, the difference between HTTP and HTTPS is that HTTPS encrypts the data packet of HTTP request and HTTP response. Let's see what HTTPS look like.<br>
            Data packets will not present in a human understanding content; instead, all the information is encrypted, and it will not be able to understand the content by human<br>
            <br>The data packet will look like this:<br>

            <br>........g..$...`:j$.n..XD8.1...@......&}@7.fR;.5......	..8nR......=9.K.....<....+...0......T..P...IW.)

    <h6> What happens if the user uses HTTP for browsing?
        <p>
            This part will perform an ARP Spoofing Attack on the victim's computer to spoof data packet sending; simultaneously, the victim will try to log in to the server under an HTTP website. 
            As result, the victim's account information sniffed by the hacker and the hacker successfully logged in to the victim's account
            This lab aims to showcase the consequences of using HTTP when browsing and why HTTPS is important in currently internet.

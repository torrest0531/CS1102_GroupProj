    <h2>Why HTTPS is more secure than HTTP?</h2>
    <h2>Data Encryption</h2>
    <p>HTTPS uses the SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt data. Data is encrypted as it is sent from the client to the server, making it impossible for an attacker to easily access sensitive information even if it is intercepted. In contrast, HTTP transmits data in plaintext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and interception.
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>Suppose you connect to an HTTP site using public Wi-Fi and submit your login credentials. Since the data is transmitted in plaintext, an attacker can easily intercept your username and password. However, if you connect to the same website using HTTPS, your data will be encrypted, making it impossible for an attacker to easily access your sensitive information.</p>

<h3>Message integrity and authenticity</h3>
    <p>HTTPS verifies the integrity of data by using message authentication codes. This means that any tampering with the data during transmission will be detected. If the data is tampered with, the receiver will sense it and can refuse to process the tampered data. HTTP, on the other hand, does not provide this mechanism, resulting in data being easily tampered with during transmission without being detected. 
    <p>Example:<p>
    <p>Assuming there is an application programming interface, which records some data and the data is public, all the data is not encrypted communication, HTTP may have the following problems: 
        <li>Integrity damage: the data content may be changed by a third party resulting in the API caller obtaining false data.</li>
        <li>Authenticity damage : The API provider has not yet returned the data, the data may have been forged by an intermediary to return a copy of the data. With MAC algorithm, the message sender calculates the MAC value based on <original message, key> and sends it together with the message to the receiver; after the receiver receives the message, it repeats the above steps to calculate the MAC value and compares it with the passed MAC value, if it is different, it means that the message has been tampered with, then it is immediately discarded.</li>

    <h3>Server identity restrictions</h3>
    <p>HTTPS uses digital certificates to authenticate a server. Digital certificates are issued by trusted third-party organisations and are used to prove that the server is legitimate and associated with a specific domain name. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and forged websites. When an HTTPS connection is established, the client verifies the server's digital certificate to ensure that the connection is destined for the intended legitimate server.
    <p>Example:<p>
    <p>Suppose you are conducting an online banking transaction and you want to make sure that you are connecting to your bank's real website and not a spoofed one. If you use an HTTP connection, an attacker could spoof a website that looks identical to your bank's and direct you to submit sensitive information. However, if you connect using HTTPS, the browser will verify the server's digital certificate, ensuring that you are connecting to a legitimate bank website. For example, the official website of the Bank of China is https://www.boc.cn/, while the fake site might be https://www.boc.cm/. The domain names of the two look similar but are completely different.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of HTTPS</h2>
    <h3>Symmetric encryption cracking and asymmetric encryption cracking</h3>
    <p>Cracking of symmetric encryption algorithms is mainly based on trial and error methods such as exhaustive attacks or dictionary attacks. These attacks try to decrypt encrypted data using various possible keys. Asymmetric Encryption Cracking: Cracking of asymmetric encryption algorithms usually involves mathematically related attacks such as large number decomposition (for the RSA algorithm) or the discrete logarithm problem (for the Elliptic Curve Encryption Algorithm). These attacks are currently very time-consuming and complex, requiring significant computational resources and time. However, with advances in computational techniques and new mathematical discoveries, certain asymmetric encryption algorithms may be potentially at risk.</p>

    <h3>Digital certificates and private keys</h3>
    <p>HTTPS relies on digital certificates to authenticate servers. If an attacker is able to forge a digital certificate or obtain a private key, they may be able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack to steal sensitive information or tamper with data.</p>

                <p>HTTP, also known as HyperText Transfer Protocol, serves as the fundamental protocol for data
                communication on the World Wide Web. HTTP was developed by Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues over the
                period of 1989-1991. It permits data transmission between web servers and clients, which requests are
                initiated by the recipient that is typically a web browser. As HTTP allows for the transmission of
                numerous sorts of data, including text, graphics, and multimedia, so all elements can be seen on web
                pages.</p>

                <h3 class="toggle">Why HTTPS Was Developed</h3>
                <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>Rapid growth of the Internet has led to an increase in web security concerns. In order to overcome the
                problems of HTTP, especially the protection of the privacy and web safety as traditional HTTP was 
                unencrypted, making data easily accessible to monitoring and distorting. Thus, HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol
                Secure) was established.</p>
                <p> HTTPS was developed to enhance the security of HTTP by implementing encryption methods 
                like SSL/TLS. This ensure that any data transmitted between the web server and the web browser is encrypted and protected.
                HTTPS also provides website authentication, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and data breaches  Moreover, it protects 
                the integrity of the data for preventing any modifications or corruption in the process of transmitting it.</p>

                <h3 class="toggle">Why HTTPS is Important</h3>
                <div class="toggle-content">
                <p>The latest developments in encryption technology have improved the performance of HTTPS, with small extra expenses 
                    compared to using HTTP and without negatively affecting the user's overall experience. Search engines such as Google
                     have begun using HTTPS as a ranking indication, motivating websites to use encrypted links in order to enhance their 
                     search exposure.</p>
                <p>Moreover, it is strongly advised that websites use HTTPS in order to satisfy rules such as the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO) 
                   in Hong Kong and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). This would enhance the secure transmission of sensitive data.</p>
                <p>These safety measures are also important for online transactions, personal data exchange and protecting privacy in the digital world. 
                    It has become essential for each website running on the internet nowadays.</p>
